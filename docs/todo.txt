List of things to do in the future (in any order):

 - Make comma (dot) appear after every three digits counting from right to left for readability (1.000.000 instead 1000000);
 - Remake rules.js completely, if possible to avoid if\then\switch\case nightmare and for cleaner code;
 - *Consider merging calculator.js and rules.js after rules.js remake;
 - Make my own parser and remove math.js library;
 - Make calculator responsive for all devices;
 - Add memory management buttons (M+, M- etc);
 - *Consider making memory management as widgets (might be complicated for phone versions);
 - Add more useful comments inside code itself:
 - Make calculator more graphicaly pleasing to the eye.

 * - Things to consider doing.
