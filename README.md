## About Author

I'm learning JavaScript for three months now and this is my first project ever, so I hope you understand I'm a beginner and it might take time for me to understand and impletent some new techniques. I learned what Git and GitHub are few days ago and I like the concept, so here I am and I hope to contribute as much as possible. Also, sorry for bad English.
